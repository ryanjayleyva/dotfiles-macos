# RJ dotfiles-macos ðŸŒ´

This is my personal macOS development environment, organized with [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow), and
includes carefully curated configurations for Zsh, Git, tmux, and a manual LSP setup compatible with Neovim 0.11.3+.

This repo keeps my development environment consistent across machines and easy to replicate.

git config user.name "Your Name"
git config user.email "your@email.com"
